# JWT Integration with Spring Boot

## Overview
This repository contains a Spring Boot application integrated with JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication and authorization purposes. JWT is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. This project demonstrates how to implement JWT-based authentication in a Spring Boot application to secure RESTful APIs.

## Features
- **JWT Generation:** Generates JWT tokens upon successful user authentication.
- **Token Validation:** Validates incoming JWT tokens to authenticate users and authorize access to protected resources.
- **User Authentication:** Provides endpoints for user login and registration.
- **Authorization:** Implements role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to certain endpoints based on user roles.
- **Token Refresh:** Supports token refresh mechanism to extend the validity of JWT tokens.
- **Secure Endpoints:** Protects sensitive endpoints using JWT-based authentication.

## Technologies Used
- Spring Boot
- Spring Security
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- Spring Data JPA
- MySQL/PostgreSQL/Sqlite (for database)
- Maven/ (for dependency management)

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Configure the database settings in the application properties file.
3. Build the project using Maven or Gradle.
4. Run the Spring Boot application.
5. Access the API endpoints using tools like Postman or integrate them with the frontend.

## Configuration
- **JWT Secret:** Update the JWT secret key in the application properties file to enhance security.
- **Token Expiration:** Configure the token expiration time according to your requirements.
